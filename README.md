Jetbrains Java projects I'm using to sharpen up my sword (I got no current Java projects).

Apparently, these are all of hard difficulty (for people who've done simple projects and want to practice the basics as well as learn new concepts).

These include:

- **JSON-XML Converter:** Program to convert formats (may try to add YAML)
- **Maze Runner:** Program generates mazes and finds a way through them
- **Simple Search Engine:** Search for text data represented as lines
- **Readability Score:** Tool to determine whether a text's readability level
- **Digit Recognition:** Building neural networks that can recognize digits
- **Sorting Tool:** Program to sort different types of data
- **Minesweeper:** Minesweeper
- **Game of Life:** Game of Life
- **Budget Manager:** Budget Manager
- **Error Correcting Encoder-Decoder:** Writing an encoder that will allow for reliable data transfer
- **Numeric Matrix Processor:** Operations on matrices
- **Tic-Tac-Toe with AI:** Create an AI to play Tic-Tac-Toe with
