Jetbrains Java projects I'm using to sharpen up my sword (I got no current Java projects).

Apparently, these are all of hard difficulty (for people who've done simple projects and want to practice the basics as well as learn new concepts).

These include:

- **Budget Manager**: Simple tool to help manage your budget and purchases
- **Digit Recognition**: 
- **Flashcards**: Application allowing you to create flashcards to help with revision
- **Linear Equations Solver**: Solve systems of linear equations (including those with complex coefficients)
- **Maze Runner**: 
- **Minesweeper**: (moved to medium)
- **Music Advisor**: 
- **Phone Book**: 
- **Simple Banking System**: Simulate a simple bank, allowing users to create accounts and deposit, transfer, withdraw funds 
- **Simple Search Engine**: Create a tool to search through a collection of names and emails
- **Smart Calculator**: Create a calculator interface to evaluate expressions, including those using variables
- **Sorting Tool**: Tool to sort words or numbers by their respective orders or by the frequency that they appear
