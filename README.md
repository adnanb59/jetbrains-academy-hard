# jetbrains-academy-hard

Jetbrains Java projects I'm using to sharpen up my sword (I got no current Java projects).

Apparently, these are all of hard difficulty (for people who've done simple projects and want to practice the basics as well as learn new concepts).

These include:

- **Contacts:** Phone book with full support of OO principles
- **Music Advisor:** TODO: description
- **JSON-XML Converter:** Program to convert formats (may try to add YAML)
- **Maze Runner:** Program generates mazes and finds a way through them
- **Minesweeper:** Minesweeper
- **Game of Life:** Game of Life
- **Budget Manager:** Budget Manager
- **Error Correcting Encoder-Decoder:** Writing an encoder that will allow for reliable data transfer
- **Numeric Matrix Processor:** Operations on matrices
- **Tic-Tac-Toe with AI:** Create an AI to play Tic-Tac-Toe with
