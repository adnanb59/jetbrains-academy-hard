## maze-runner

This is a fun program that uses Graph algorithms to allow users to create and solve (well, show the solution to) mazes.

Users can't solve mazes interactively with the program but this program is neat if you are looking for mazes to solve.

> I know that the project name maze-runner suggests that there's an interactive aspect where one would solve the maze but I'm just using the Jetbrains project name.

On top of just simply creating mazes, you can also export them to a text file and load them later (to view the maze and/or it's solution).

### Running Program

After compiling program using `javac src/Runner.java`, run program with `java src/Runner`.

Once the program starts, the user will be prompted with a menu with options to initialize a maze.
